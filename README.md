# Grafana x HackUPC challenge

You have arrived at the homepage for the Grafana x HackUPC challenge! We hope you find it interesting, and that you have a lot of fun while hacking on it!

Our IoT challenge has quite some moving parts, but we think that's the fun part! I can however be a bit intimidating at times, so we have prepared some resources to help you along the way.
